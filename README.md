## Description:

- The Bank Loan Report Dashboard is designed to provide comprehensive insights into the loan applications, funded amounts, and repayments within a financial institution. The dashboard includes visual summaries of key metrics such as total loan applications, funded amounts, amount received, interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios. It also highlights the distribution of good and bad loans, loan status by various categories, and trends over time.

## Objectives and Goals:

- To monitor and analyze the performance of loan portfolios.
- To identify trends in loan disbursement and repayment.
- To assess the distribution of loan statuses (e.g., current, fully paid, charged-off).
- To provide actionable insights for optimizing loan management strategies.
  
## Scope: 
- The dashboard covers loan data across multiple states, loan purposes, employee lengths, and ownership statuses. It is designed for monthly and year-over-year comparisons.

## Limitations: 
- The dashboard is limited to the data available and may not account for external factors affecting loan performance. Some granular details might not be visible due to data aggregation.
  
## Data Source:
- The data for this dashboard is sourced from the bank's loan management system, which tracks loan applications, disbursements, repayments, and customer details.

- Data Validation: Ensured that all fields were correctly populated and that there were no missing or erroneous entries.
- Categorization: Grouped loans by status (e.g., Fully Paid, Current, Charged Off) and other relevant categories.
- Normalization: Standardized date formats and numeric fields for consistency.
- Aggregation: Summarized data by month, year, and other dimensions to facilitate trend analysis.
